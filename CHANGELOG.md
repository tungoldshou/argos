# Changelog

All notable changes to Argos are documented here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Agent claimed it had no internet** even though web tools were wired up. The
  system prompt (`HONESTY_SYSTEM`) only advertised file/command tools, so the
  model "honestly" refused web queries (e.g. weather) instead of calling
  `web_search`. Prompt now lists all three tool classes (file / command / web)
  and instructs the model to search before saying it can't. Verified
  end-to-end: asking weather now triggers a real `web_search` call.

### Added
- **验证门防作弊**：受保护测试被改/增/删时判"无法验证"并诚实升级，不再被"偷改测试让它过"蒙混；指纹由 mtime/size 升级为内容 sha256。
- **`package-app` project skill** (`.claude/skills/package-app/`) — the build
  runbook for rebuilding the arm64 PyInstaller sidecar and repackaging the
  `.app`/`.dmg`, including the x86_64-venv trap and spec-parity rules.
- **Agent chat skeleton (Phase 1 of the chat-experience epic)** — two-column
  shell (left chat column max-width 760px centered, right side exposes the
  background memory brain), `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `rehype-highlight`
  with custom code blocks (language label + copy button), `chatReducer` that
  merges SSE events into ordered `Block[]` per turn, `HonestyCard` for
  verify/escalation/tampering signals, collapsible `ActivityTrail` for tool
  steps, multi-line auto-grow `Composer` with `Enter` send / `Shift+Enter`
  newline and `onSlash`/`leftSlot`/`rightSlot` extension hooks for Phases 2/5/6,
  collapsible `TaskSetup` for verify/project/guard settings. `AgentPanel` is
  lazy-loaded so the main bundle stays at 278 KB / 95 KB gzip; the markdown
  stack (~348 KB) only loads when the user opens chat. See
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-02-agent-chat-redesign-design.md` and
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-02-agent-chat-skeleton.md`.
- **Real token streaming** — `agent.astream(..., stream_mode=["values","messages"])`
  emits a new `token` SSE event for each `AIMessageChunk` text delta; the
  `message` event is preserved as the authoritative finalization (frontend
  reducer uses it to overwrite any accumulated tokens and prevent drift).
  Reasoning-model `thinking` content is filtered out (`text_delta` helper).
  Verified end-to-end with a real LLM: 6 incremental `token` frames → 1
  `message` finalization → `done`.
- **Component test infrastructure** — `vitest` with `jsdom` + `@testing-library/react`
  + `@testing-library/jest-dom`; 28 new component tests + 11 reducer tests
  for the chat skeleton.
- **CSS tokens** — `--warn` / `--danger` / `--danger-strong` so the honesty
  cards, error blocks, and Composer stop button share one source of color truth.
- **`Highlight.js` dark theme** — 13-line handcrafted stylesheet matching the
  argos palette, paired with `rehype-highlight`.

### Changed
- `.gitignore` now tracks `.claude/skills/` (shared project skills) while still
  ignoring local `.claude` state; root `/build/` ignored.
- `AgentEvent['type']` gained `'token'` for the streaming event; reducer and
  downstream rendering path handle the new event as a first-class stream.
- Project-guide `CLAUDE.md` now mandates Chinese as the user-facing reply
  language.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-01

First packaged build (`Argos.app` + DMG, native arm64). Argos is a standalone
general-purpose agent (Tauri shell + Python LangGraph sidecar), pivoted from the
earlier Hermes-swarm prototype.

### Added
- **Standalone agent core** — LangGraph ReAct loop over a provider-agnostic LLM
  factory (any OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible endpoint; defaults to MiniMax).
- **Agent tools (7)** — `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file` (with
  whitespace-fuzzy fallback matching), `run_command` (whitelisted),
  `search_files`, `web_search` (DDGS free / Tavily upgrade), `web_extract`
  (trafilatura + LLM compression). File access caged to the workspace; web is
  read-only.
- **Honesty + verify guardrails** — honesty protocol in the system prompt,
  fail-closed verdict parsing, verify hard-gate with escalation and
  tamper-detection.
- **Multi-turn chat** — in-process session state with first-turn-locked setup,
  LRU eviction, single-flight run lock to prevent cross-session races.
- **MindGraph UI** — memory graph that grows from real task activity; brain
  re-anchors/re-fits on window resize while docked.
- **Settings** — provider/base/model/key form, language toggle (EN/中),
  packaged key injection (Settings → config file → Rust → sidecar env).
- **Packaging** — PyInstaller single-file sidecar bundled into the Tauri build;
  `pnpm tauri build` produces `.app` + `.dmg`.

### Changed
- Migrated off Hermes branding throughout the UI (center node, command bar,
  model labels); tool counts now reflect the real 7 tools instead of seed "60+".
